You want to bet with your friends on sport events? zock! is the web based tool for you, simply because i made it for me & my friends. It's designed for events as a soccer championship or similar!

Until now the software supports these betting modes:
Bet on:
  * Score
  * Toto (3-way result)

Modes:
  * Just Points
  * With a stake for the betting game or per match (different calculations possible!)

Requirements:
 * PHP, MySQL and Firefox ;)

The installation requires some knowledge of PHP and MySQL I suppose, since it will not work as smoothly as expected. Feedback about particular obstacles are very welcome 
and will be addressed!

Questions and Bugs here on GitHub, please. This software is distributed under the GPL license and will always be distributed under this or a similar Open Source software license.

Enjoy the Software!
